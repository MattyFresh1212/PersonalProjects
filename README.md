**UMD Class Input Script**\
This script uses the CMD and requires for me to select the class I am currently attending . With such information, the script will automaticly join you into the zoom class at the requested time provided that you have zoom installed.

**UMD Class Time Script**\
This script is basicly the same as the **Input Script** but it is set up for my 2020-2021 classes.
