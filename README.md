**UMD Class Input Script**
This script uses the CMD and requires for user to input the zoom class and zoom link as well as the time of class. With such information, the script will automaticly join you into the zoom class at the requested time provided that you have zoom installed.

**UMD Class Time Script**
This script is basicly the same as the **Input Script** but it is set up for my 2020-2021 classes.
